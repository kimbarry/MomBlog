        <h2>Welcome to my blog</h2>
        <img>
        <p>Parenting during my time on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant has been a unique and challenging 
            experience. As a Starfleet officer and a single mother to my daughter, Naomi, I navigate the 
            complexities of raising her in an unpredictable and often dangerous environment. The isolation 
            of the Delta Quadrant has fostered a close bond between us; we rely on each other for emotional 
            support amidst the constant threat of alien encounters and the uncertainty of our journey home. 
            I strive to provide a sense of normalcy and stability for Naomi, introducing her to the wonders 
            of space exploration while instilling in her the values of resilience, courage, and compassion. 
            The crew of Voyager has become our extended family, offering a supportive community that helps 
            us share in both the joys and challenges of life among the stars.
